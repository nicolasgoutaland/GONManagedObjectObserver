  						When using CoreData, it is often difficult to handle objects deletion / updates.
						NSFetchedResultsController are greate for list, but to observe only one object, they are overkill.
						A lot of application crash can occurs is you access to a previously deleted NSManagedObject.
						Also, your UI can be outdated if you are updateing your NSManagedObject in a background thread for example.
						This class simplify NSManagedObject update / deletion, providing a block syntaxe and some useful categories.
